# Always a WIP

this is my personal config

## Todo

# Trying to use the runtimepath in an optimal way

check `:h runtimepath` if you want to know more about it.

- `/lua/...`: I use this folders for option, lazy loading and _currently_ keymaps
- `plugin/`: plugin scripts, normally loaded in alphabetical order but impatient changes that
- `after/..`: for preferences to overrule or add to defaults
